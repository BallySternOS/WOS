# PinballMachineBase
This is a bare bones implementation of a base pinball machine. It has an attract mode, self-test mode, and game play. The player can add credits, start a game, and experience some basic gameplay. The defines are based on Stellar Wars (in PinballMachineBase.h). Change those switch, lamp, and solenoid definitions to test on other platforms.
